# API Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Client-Side API Key Requirement**
- **Problem**: `geminiDirectService.ts` was trying to use direct API calls which would expose your API key in the browser
- **Solution**: Modified the service to call Netlify functions instead of direct API calls

### 2. **Cleaned Up Redundant Services**
- **Problem**: Had two similar services (`geminiService.ts` and `geminiDirectService.ts`) doing the same thing
- **Solution**: Removed `geminiService.ts` and updated `geminiDirectService.ts` to use the secure server-side approach

### 3. **Fixed Environment Variable Configuration**
- **Problem**: Confusion between client-side and server-side API configurations
- **Solution**: App now only needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env` file for Netlify functions

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (React) → Netlify Function (/api/translate) → Gemini API
                 → Netlify Function (/api/tts) → Google Translate TTS
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Important**:
- Use `GEMINI_API_KEY` (server-side only)
- This keeps your API key secure on the server-side
- Never expose API keys in client-side environment variables

## Testing

1. Create your `.env` file with the correct `GEMINI_API_KEY`
2. Run: `npm run netlify:dev`
3. Test the translation functionality

The error you saw (`ECONNREFUSED ::1:3001`) should be resolved since the app now properly routes through Netlify functions instead of trying to connect to a non-existent local server.
